# Project Proposal: Computational Protein Design Framework

## Problem
Wet-lab protein discovery is expensive, slow, and low-throughput.

## Solution
A computational framework that filters protein candidates before
experimental validation using ML and molecular simulation proxies.

## Innovation
- Open, reproducible, citable
- Low computational barrier
- Designed for research teams, not black-box prediction

## Expected Outcome
- Reduced experimental cost
- Faster hypothesis iteration
- Improved research efficiency

## Deliverables
- Open-source code
- DOI-backed artifact
- Benchmark results
- Validation documentation
