# Computational Protein Design – Use Case
Early-stage sequence screening & feasibility filtering
## Objective
Demonstrate how computational screening reduces experimental cost
by filtering protein candidates before wet-lab validation.
Sequence → Encoding → ML Prediction → Structural Proxy → Decision
# Load model and evaluate sample protein
encoded_sequence = np.random.rand(1, 20)
prediction = model.predict(encoded_sequence)
prediction
Predictions guide which sequences are worth downstream validation.
