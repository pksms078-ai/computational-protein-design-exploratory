# Project Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Completed ✅
- Core ML pipeline for sequence-level exploration
- Molecular dynamics integration
- Open-source release
- Validation and benchmarking
- DOI registration (Zenodo)

## Phase 2 — Short Term (Next 3–6 months)
- Improved feature encoding (embeddings, physicochemical properties)
- Expanded benchmarking against baseline models
- Modular refactoring (ML / Simulation separation)
- Enhanced documentation & tutorials

## Phase 3 — Medium Term
- Integration with protein language models (PLMs)
- Active learning loop between ML and simulation
- Distributed simulation orchestration
- Improved interpretability metrics

## Phase 4 — Long Term (Lab / Industry Collaboration)
- Wet-lab validation in collaboration with experimental teams
- Comparative studies with experimental assays
- Peer-reviewed publication
- Domain-specific applications (enzymes, therapeutics, materials)

## Vision
To provide a transparent, reproducible computational framework that reduces experimental cost, time, and risk in protein research.
