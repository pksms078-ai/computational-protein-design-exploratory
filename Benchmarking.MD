## Benchmarking Scope & Baseline

This framework is benchmarked as an exploratory, pre-validation computational system.
It is NOT intended to replace experimental protein design tools,
but to reduce hypothesis space prior to wet-lab investment.
## Comparative Positioning

| Tool / Framework | Purpose | Stage |
|------------------|--------|-------|
| AlphaFold | Structure prediction | Late-stage |
| Rosetta | Energy optimization | Design refinement |
| ProteinMPNN | Sequence generation | Targeted design |
| **This Framework** | Hypothesis filtering | Early-stage |
“This framework complements existing tools by operating earlier in the design lifecycle.”
## Benchmarking Metrics

The framework is evaluated on:
- Computational cost
- Reproducibility of results
- Transparency of assumptions
- Ease of integration into downstream pipelines
## Benchmarking Limitations

- No experimental validation included
- Not optimized for final protein efficacy
- Designed for exploration, not deployment
