# Limitations

This project represents an exploratory computational framework intended to
reduce the protein design search space and support early-stage hypothesis
generation. The following limitations are explicitly acknowledged to ensure
scientific transparency and responsible interpretation.

---

## 1. Biological Validation Limitation
- The framework does **not claim biological efficacy** or experimental success.
- No wet-lab validation (in vitro / in vivo) is performed within this work.
- Outputs should be interpreted as **computational signals**, not biological proof.

---

## 2. Dataset Constraints
- Model performance is dependent on the quality, size, and diversity of input
  protein sequence datasets.
- Limited or biased datasets may lead to overfitting or reduced generalization.

---

## 3. Simplified Feature Representation
- Protein sequences are represented using simplified numerical encodings.
- Higher-order biochemical, evolutionary, and contextual features may not be
  fully captured.

---

## 4. Machine Learning Scope
- The ML models used are **foundational and exploratory**, not state-of-the-art
  deep protein foundation models.
- The objective is pattern exploration, not competitive benchmark dominance.

---

## 5. Molecular Dynamics Approximation
- Molecular dynamics simulations are limited by:
  - Simulation time scale
  - Force-field assumptions
  - Computational resource constraints
- Results reflect **structural tendencies**, not definitive folding outcomes.

---

## 6. Computational Resource Dependency
- Large-scale sequence screening and long-timescale simulations require
  high-performance computing resources.
- Results may vary across hardware and execution environments.

---

## 7. Interpretation Limitation
- Predictions indicate *relative plausibility*, not absolute correctness.
- Human expertise is required for biological interpretation and experimental planning.

---

## 8. Non-Clinical and Non-Commercial Use
- This framework is **not intended for clinical, therapeutic, or commercial claims**.
- Any downstream application requires independent validation and regulatory review.

---

## Summary
This work is designed to **assist decision-making**, not replace experimental science.
Its value lies in narrowing possibilities, documenting assumptions, and enabling
reproducible exploration.

# Limitations

This repository presents an exploratory computational framework for protein design.
The following limitations are explicitly acknowledged to ensure scientific transparency and responsible use.

---

## Biological Validation Limitations

- The framework does **not claim experimental or clinical validation**.
- All results are computational and intended for **hypothesis generation**, not biological confirmation.
- Wet-lab validation (expression, folding, binding, activity assays) is outside the scope of this work.

---

## Dataset Constraints

- Model performance is dependent on the quality, size, and representativeness of input
