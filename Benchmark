# Comparative Benchmark (Conceptual)

This project does NOT attempt to biologically outperform AlphaFold or Rosetta.

## Benchmark Focus
- Pipeline scalability
- Computational cost
- Early-stage hypothesis screening

| Tool        | Purpose                     | Compute Cost | Output Type |
|------------|-----------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| AlphaFold  | Final structure prediction  | Very High    | 3D Fold     |
| Rosetta    | Physics-based modeling      | High         | Energetics  |
| **This Work** | Early-stage filtering     | Low–Medium   | Feasible Candidates |

## Key Insight
This framework is designed to **reduce experimental search space**, not replace lab validation.
