Exploratory computational framework for protein sequence modeling and folding analysis using machine learning and simulations.
# Computational Protein Design (Exploratory)

## Overview
This repository presents an exploratory computational framework for protein
design, integrating machine learning-based sequence modeling and basic molecular
simulation workflows.

The project is intended as a proof-of-concept to study feasibility, assumptions,
and limitations in computational protein engineering.

## Scope
- In silico analysis only
- No experimental validation
- Baseline models and simulations

## Key Components
- Machine learning models for protein sequence representation
- Simplified molecular dynamics workflows
- Conceptual integration of ML and protein folding

## Disclaimer
This repository represents independent exploratory research and is not intended
for clinical or commercial use.
